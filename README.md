## Overview
This project aims to serve as a CLI tool to make easy the use of different PHP tools related to Quality Assurance and code analysis in PHP.

Every analyzer tool handles arguments and options using different formats, the goal of this project is to provide a single way to interact with those projects, you can also set options and arguments using a default configuration file when the project supports it.

> This project was originally developed as part of [Drupal Console](https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole) and based on the blog post [Write your git hooks in PHP and keep them under git control](http://carlosbuenosvinos.com/write-your-git-hooks-in-php-and-keep-them-under-git-control/).

## Available Analyzers

$ git clone git@github.com:jmolivas/phpqa.git
$ cd phpqa
# download dependencies
$ composer install
# make phpqa globally accessible creating a symlink
$ ln -s bin/phpqa /usr/local/bin/phpqa
```

## Usage

### Copy configuration file(s)
```
$ cd to/project/path
$ phpqa init --project=PROJECT --override
$ phpqa init --global --override
```
| Option   | Description |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| project  | Available values `php`, `symfony` and `drupal`. |
| global   | Copy configuration files to user home directory, instead of current working directory. |
| override | If this option is set, files are copied using override flag. |

**NOTES:**
- Option `global` does not accept a value must be set as `--global`.
- Option `override` does not accept a value must be set as `--override`.
- Options `project` and `global` can not used in combination.

### Analyze a project
```
$ cd to/project/path
$ phpqa analyze --project=PROJECT --files=FILES
$ phpqa analyze --project=PROJECT --git
```

| Option  | Description |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| project | Available values `php`, `symfony` and `drupal` |
| files   | Files or directories to analyze. |
| git     | If this option is set, all files added to git index will be scanned. This is useful when setting executing this tool on a pre-commit git-hook. |

**NOTES:**
- Option `git` does not accept a value must be set as `--git`.
- Option `project` could be omitted if a `phpqa.yml` or `phpqa.yml.dist` file is available at current working directory.

## Override configuration
This project was built to be fully customizable, you can enable/disable analyzers and modify arguments/options passed to analyzers by updating the `phpqa.yml` or `phpqa.yml.dist` file on your project root copied when running `init` command, or the files `~/.phpqa/php/config.yml`, `~/.phpqa/symfony/config.yml` or `~/.phpqa/drupal/config.yml` copied when running `init` command using `--global` option.

## Nice to have features
- Add command to create new project.
- Add more analyzers:
   - https://github.com/pdepend/pdepend
   - https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-checker
   - https://github.com/sensiolabs/insight
   - https://github.com/Halleck45/PhpMetrics
- Add analyzer via config and not as composer dependency.
- Detect if analyzer is already loaded on the local machine and use that instead of download.
- Add custom analyzers.
- Add SaaS analyzers via API.

> This project is a work-in-progress and needs some love related to code clean up, test coverage and documentation.
